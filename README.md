# zowe-client-go-sdk

This Go SDK is a sub-project of Zowe, focusing on modernizing mainframe experience. Zowe is a project hosted by the Open Mainframe Project, a Linux Foundation project.


The SDK lets you leverage the underlying z/OSMF REST APIs on a z/OS system to build applications that interface with the mainframe.

The goal is to provide Java developers an SDK to easily interface with a backend mainframe from any computer that has a GVM. The SDK will do the leg work to allow you to interface with z/OS services. These services provides access to the mainframe in ways where you can build automation, testing, and devOps applications without the need to build those directly on the mainframe itself, and as such, opens these applications to modern tools.
